This is a 3-module asset tracking embedded system (marker, tracer, base), the prototype creates a 3-dimensional space with several short length radio wave transmitter as `Marker`. The `Tracer` collecting nearby signal of the `Marker` and predicting an accurate object location by using #MachineLearning. Object can be trace in x, y and z space when the object moving around within the `Marker` radius.",
